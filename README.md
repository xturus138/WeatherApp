# WeatherApp 🌦️

WeatherApp is a basic weather application created for learning purposes. This app includes a few essential weather features to help users check current weather conditions. Due to the limitations of free APIs, only a small set of features is available, and the interface is kept simple and functional without advanced UI design. 

## 📋 Project Overview

**WeatherApp** was built to explore basic API usage, working with simple weather data, and practicing responsive design. It offers current weather information for a user’s location or selected cities worldwide using a free-tier API. While many advanced features aren't available due to paid API restrictions, this project serves as a good introduction to building simple apps with external data.

### Goals and Intentions

The main goals for **WeatherApp** include:

1. **Basic API Integration:** Understanding how to connect to and retrieve data from a public API.
2. **Responsive Layout Practice:** Ensuring the app works reasonably on different screen sizes.
3. **Simple User Interface:** Focusing on basic usability rather than advanced design.

## 🔑 Basic Features (Free Version)

- **Current Weather Data**: Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more with explanation for the user's location or selected cities.
- **City Search**: A simple search feature for checking weather in other locations.
- **Widget**:  Offer an easy-to-add widget for the home screen.
- **Forecast**: Predict weather for the next 7 days.

## 🚧 Potential Future Additions

Several features were left out due to API restrictions or are ideas for further exploration:

- **Weather Alerts**: Notifications for extreme weather conditions.
- **Weather Map**: A map displaying weather data visually.
- **Weather History**: History for past weather data.
- **And More**

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

WeatherApp is built with:

- **Android Development**: Kotlin, XML for layouts
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for a structured, testable, and maintainable codebase
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap (free-tier) for weather data
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for progress tracking and collaboration
